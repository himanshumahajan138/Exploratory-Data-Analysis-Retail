# Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
## Task 1 Data Science Internship [The Sparks Foundation]
## Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project in the retail domain. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves exploring and understanding the data before making any data-driven decisions.

In this project, we analyze a retail dataset to uncover insights, trends, and patterns that can inform business decisions. The dataset includes information about sales, profit, discounts, product categories, regions, and more.

## Project Overview
Here's an overview of what this EDA project covers:

### 1. Setup and Data Loading
We begin by setting up the Python environment and loading the dataset using libraries such as pandas, numpy, and seaborn.

### 2. Data Overview
We examine the structure of the dataset, including data types, missing values, and basic statistics. This helps us understand the dataset's characteristics.

### 3. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
To ensure data integrity, we perform data cleaning tasks, such as handling missing values, converting data types, and removing duplicates.

### 4. Data Visualization
Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the data. We create various plots, including KDE plots, pairplots, count plots, and distribution plots, to visualize the data and identify patterns.

### 5. Correlation Analysis
We calculate correlations between numerical variables and visualize them in a heatmap to understand relationships within the data.

### 6. Statewise and Citywise Analysis
Geographical analysis is conducted to identify states and cities with the highest and lowest numbers of deals. Visualizations provide geographical insights.

### 7. Segment and Category Analysis
We delve into segment and category analysis, uncovering trends in sales, discounts, and profit for different segments and product categories.

### 8. Sub-Category Analysis
Sub-category analysis focuses on examining sales, discounts, and profit for individual sub-categories, highlighting high and low-performing sub-categories.

### 9. Region and Ship Mode Analysis
Analysis by region and shipping mode helps us understand how different regions and shipping methods impact the business.

## Conclusion and Takeaways
In the conclusion section, we summarize the key findings from our EDA. We emphasize how EDA can guide data-driven decision-making in a business context.
